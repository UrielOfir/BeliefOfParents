When I was a young mother, I took a parenting course in the Sheffer Approach. This
education philosophy believes that the child usually adapts his behavior to the
expectations of his parents.
I found myself tired in front of my son, in the middle of the night, trying to figure
out if my expectations of him were realistic and good for him or not. Over time, I
formulated some self-questions on this topic, and after I come up with the answers for them,
I would memorize the statements, which I now recommend in this project.

When I found myself missing writing code and felt ready to find a career in
software development, I started studying Python and this project is a product
of the first phase of this self-study.

I am hope you enjoy and benefit from this project :)
