# BeliefOfParents

An app for parents, who want to put their children to sleep out of trust; in python. By Fridi Taichman.

Parenting according to Sheffer's approach believes that the child adapts his behavior to the expectations of his parents. 
This project contains some self-questions about child readiness for sleep and recommendations for self-memorization that will raise the parent's belief in his expectations.
