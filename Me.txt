I grew up in an ultra-Orthodox Israeli family of eleven people. About five years ago
I got divorced and left the ultra-Orthodox community alone with my baby and without support;
in a difficult and long process, I graduated with a degree in computer science, completed my
gaps in English, and gained knowledge in cybersecurity and IT,
as a cybersecurity engineer at the Israeli Electric Company.

My goal for 2021 is to find a Junior Software Developer position,
and turn my passion to a career.


So here is my LinkedIn profile :)
