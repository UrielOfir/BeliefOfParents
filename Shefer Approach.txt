
The Shefer approach is a renewed classic philosophy based upon Alfred Adler's
psychological principles. The approach strives to solve  issues that modern
parents often struggle with, among them: loss of parental authority, confusion
regarding numerous educational choices, feelings of parental guilt, and children's
lack of identification with the family's core values. Parents who use the Shefer
approach learn to identify faulty dynamics that have been unconsciously created
between them and each of their children. Once identified, they then learn how to
alter those dynamics in order to create a spirit of cooperation. All of this is
done with the underlying principle that parents are not to blame, and the children
are not being defiant; rather the unwanted dynamics came about because of unconscious
mistakes that then become ingrained in the parent-child relationship.
